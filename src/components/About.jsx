      A former task force agent, Varun Batra is the unexpected owner of an
      ancient and powerful artifact with the power to control and summon masses
      of water out of nothing. Previously working for REALM to recover such
      sorts of items from the black market and return them to their rightful
      owners, Batra was regarded as a kind-hearted man but also a deadly force
      to deal with in combat. His dedication to the cause through years of
      service fighting criminals earned him a reputation as a hero and a legend.
